## Overview

This is a second version of the Hometown Homepage project. The original version was done using Vanilla JS and was not responsive. This one is done using React and is responsive.

### The challenge

Apply basic knowledge gained about React from Scrimba's React Basics section. Additionally, learn how to create a React app using Vite.

## My process

Write the `App` component first; this way I have an outline of what overall components I need to build. Then go one level deeper into the component and build the components necessary to render the app. Create reuseable components that can be utilized in the already-created, higher-level components (eg. `Activity` component for `Activities` component).

### Built with

HTML, CSS, React, and Vite

### What I learned

If I am writing duplicate templates of the same (general) JSX, I can create a reusable component (as I did with the `Activity` component). The different content in the templates can be passed using `props`.
